Bug fixes:
- Translate all text into Swedish
- Render the actual deck, with the next card on top
- Make sure cards that are of equal emissions go on both sides of the emissions line
- Emissions line cards are too small and difficult to read. Also you can't zoom in on them.
- Select card bug: Shadow cards should update visibility when opponent card is played to emissions line, since new shadow card is added.
- Allow deselecting card by clicking elsewhere than on the card.
- Disallow selecting card unless it is your turn.
- Improve card placement with the hands not blocking the emissions line
- Some weird out of sync bug exists which leads to really weird issues. Try making sure that joining a room and restarting a game resets the game instance.
- Rendering two cards looks weird. Look over the card arrangement algorithm.
- Clarify whose turn it is using another, more obvious visual cue, such as changing the background of the active player
- What happens if deck runs out of cards?

Features:
- Turn timer
- Player name

Fixed but uncommitted:
- Whose turn it is is now visible in the bottom right
- Incorrectly placed cards are put in the discard pile
- Show game ID somewhere, preferably at the top

Fixed but unpublished:
- Fix card hover space bug (I believe it is too small currently, at least vertically it doesn't cover the whole card)
- Can't read the number at the bottom right of the card unless zoomed in
- Shadows are missing in the emissions line
