- CLIENT: Show card a few seconds before discarding it when you play a card in the wrong place

------------------

Bug fixes:
- Fix card selection space bug (I believe it is too small currently, at least vertically it doesn't cover the whole card)
- Can't read the number at the bottom right of the card unless zoomed in
- Clarify whose turn it is with text and not just card zoom in. Maybe remove the card zoom? Or not? Check other designs for inspiration.
- Show game ID somewhere, preferably at the top
- Translate all text into Swedish
- Render the actual deck, with the next card on top
- Make sure cards that are of equal emissions go on both sides of the emissions line
- Emissions line cards are too small and difficult to read. Also you can't zoom in on them.
- Select card bug: Shadow cards should update visibility when card is played to emissions line, since new shadow card is added.
- Allow deselecting card by clicking elsewhere than on the card.
- Disallow selecting card unless it is your turn.
- Improve card placement with the hands not blocking the emissions line

Features:
- Turn timer
