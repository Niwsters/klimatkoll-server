Bug fixes and tweaks:
- Render the actual deck, with the next card on top
- Make sure cards that are of equal emissions go on both sides of the emissions line
- Emissions line cards are too small and difficult to read. Also you can't zoom in on them.
- Select card bug: Shadow cards should update visibility when opponent card is played to emissions line, since new shadow card is added.
- Allow deselecting card by clicking elsewhere than on the card.
- Disallow selecting card unless it is your turn.
- Improve card placement with the hands not blocking the emissions line
- Some weird out of sync bug exists which leads to really weird issues. Try making sure that joining a room and restarting a game resets the game instance.
- Rendering two cards looks weird. Look over the card arrangement algorithm.
- Clarify whose turn it is using another, more obvious visual cue, such as changing the background of the active player
- What happens if deck runs out of cards?
- Optimise build size for better loading time: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/optimizing_for_size.html
- The click area of the card shadows were not completely intuitive. Might have been fixed with the increased vertical click area.
- Bug: Room ID disappears when starting new game
- New game vote doesn't show when you or the opponent voted
